# Personal Website  

## Overview  
This is my personal website, designed to showcase my Visual Arts portfolio. Built completely from scratch, the current design is entirely my own, created with:  
- **HTML**: Structured the website's layout and architecture.  
- **CSS**: Enhanced user interface design for an engaging and cohesive experience.  
- **JavaScript**: Enabled dynamic interactions and responsive features.  

The website offers an interactive and user-friendly browsing experience, featuring:  
- **Interactive Image Galleries**: Explore artwork with modal functionality for enhanced viewing.  
- **Responsive Design**: Uses CSS media queries to adjust its layout and design based on the user's device size
  - On smaller screens; the font sizes, image scaling, and navigation menus adjust to ensure the content is easy to read and navigate.
  - On larger screens; the layout expands to take advantage of the available space, offering an optimized viewing experience.  

## Current Features  
- **Main Screen**: A welcoming homepage, allowing you to select About Me, Portfolio, or Featured Art.  
- **About Me Section**: Learn more about me, and my artistic journey.  
- **Portfolio Section**: A dedicated gallery showcasing my Visual Arts portfolio.  
- **Featured Art Section**: Highlights some of my favourite pieces for special emphasis.  

## Future Plans  
Although this project is currently complete, I plan to enhance the website further:  
1. **Frontend Redesign**: Introduce a theme inspired by an art studio to better reflect my personality and creative process.  
2. **Additional Sections**:  
   - **Concert Photography**: A dedicated gallery for my concert photography work.  
   - **Software Development Projects**: Highlighting my technical projects.  
3. **Performance Optimization**: Improve the website's speed, particularly image loading times.
