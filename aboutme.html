                    <h2> Hi! I'm Nora Liu! </h2>
                    <p>
                        Welcome to my creative space on the internet! I am currently a second-year computer
                        engineering student at the University of Toronto. Outside of being a student,
                        I also enjoy visual arts and photography. This website is a space where I bring
                        together my technical expertise and creative pursuits.

                    <h2> My Journey into Visual Arts and Engineering </h2>
                    <p>
                        My journey into the world of art began as a hobby, leading me to audition and
                        attend an arts high school! There, I graduated with a regional visual arts
                        certificate, laying a strong foundation for my creative endeavours. While those
                        four years of high school were filled with creative exploration, I also
                        discovered a strong interest in math and sciences, which ultimately guided me
                        toward engineering. Now that I'm in computer engineering and love what I'm
                        studying, I still enjoy revisiting my creative pursuits during my spare time
                        with visual arts!
                    </p>

                    <h2> Visual Arts </h2>
                    <p>
                        My favourite medium is oil painting, and you'll see a lot of that on this website. I also
                        love using gouache, watercolour, and graphite. A lot of my artwork reflects what
                        I worked on during high school, showcasing my creative growth and exploration.

                    <h2> Why This Website? </h2>
                    <p>
                        I created this website as a personal portfolio to showcase my art and photography.
                        It's a place where I can share my artistic projects, document my creative process, and connect
                        with others who share similar interests.

                        Feel free to explore my website and reach out if you have any questions or just
                        want to say hello! I'm always open to collaboration and new opportunities.
