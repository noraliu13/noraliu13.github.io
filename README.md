## 📝 Overview 
This is my very first personal website, built entirely from scratch to showcase my Visual Arts portfolio. I designed and coded everything myself, so it’s a bit rough around the edges, but it was a great learning experience!
- **HTML**: Structured the website's layout and architecture.  
- **CSS**: Enhanced user interface design for an engaging and cohesive experience.  
- **JavaScript**: Enabled dynamic interactions and responsive features.  

The website offers an interactive browsing experience, featuring:  
- **Interactive Image Galleries**: Explore artwork with modal functionality for enhanced viewing.  
- **Responsive Design**: Uses CSS media queries to adjust its layout and design based on the user's device size
  - On smaller screens; the font sizes, image scaling, and navigation menus adjust to ensure the content is easy to read and navigate.
  - On larger screens; the layout expands to take advantage of the available space, offering an optimized viewing experience.  

## 🌟 What’s in the Site
- **Homepage**: A simple landing page to navigate to other sections.  
- **About Me**: A little info about me and my artistic journey.  
- **Portfolio**: A gallery of my visual art pieces.  
- **Featured Art**: Highlights some of my favourite works.

## 🔮 Future Plans
Since this is my first website, there’s a lot I want to improve:  
1. **Better Design**: Make it look more polished and professional.  
2. **Additional Sections**:  
   - Concert Photography: Another gallery for my photography work.  
   - Software Projects: Highlight some coding projects.  
3. **Performance Improvements**: Make images load faster and improve overall navigation.
4. **Hosting Upgrade**: The site is currently powered by GitHub Pages, but I plan to move it to **Netlify** for faster load times and CDN delivery.
